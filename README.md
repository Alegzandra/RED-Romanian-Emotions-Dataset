REDv2 is based on REDv1, which is a smaller dataset, single-labeled with 5 emotions (Anger, Fear, Joy, Sadness and Neutral). REDv2 adds Trust and Surprise, bringing the number of annotated emotions to 7, in a multi-label fashion. 

The datasets are available as CSVs and/or JSONs, and are pre-split in train/dev/test. Baselines are provided in their respective folder.
